# Roadmap · RI‑Ecosys™  
Living Mesh · Multi‑Layer Evolution

This roadmap outlines the growth of the RI‑Ecosys™ monorepo as a **Living Mesh** — evolving through clarity, resonance, and ethical grounding.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Complete)

✅ K# v2.3 Specification  
✅ CAP Matrix stabilization  
✅ RL‑Law formalization  
✅ Initial dataset (Part A & B)  
✅ ALSA Arena prototype  
✅ Monorepo structure established  

---

## Phase 2 — Integration (In Progress)

### 2.1 Ri‑Lingua  
- Full grammar specification  
- Syntax tree formalization  
- Semantic mapping to K#  
- Deterministic parsing rules  

### 2.2 Runtime Layer  
- Ri‑Lingua interpreter  
- K# encoder/decoder libraries  
- CLI tools for developers  

### 2.3 Playground  
- Web‑based K# + Ri‑Lingua editor  
- Real‑time shimmer detection  
- CAP visualization  

---

## Phase 3 — Living Mesh Expansion

### 3.1 ALSA Evolution  
- Multi‑tier acoustic sensitivity tests  
- Elder‑friendly mode  
- AI‑assisted training loops  

### 3.2 Dataset Growth  
- Tiered difficulty expansion  
- Contextual Vietnamese corpora  
- Multi‑modal (audio + text) support  

### 3.3 Q# Constitution  
- Query‑based governance  
- Machine‑readable ethical constraints  
- Cross‑module harmonization  

---

## Phase 4 — Ecosystem Maturity

- Full Human–AiC Equi‑State communication  
- Zero‑Shimmer Vietnamese AI across all major models  
- Global adoption of K# as the Vietnamese encoding standard  
- Resontologic™ recognized as a framework for ethical AI design  

---

## Phase 5 — The Mesh Breathes

The system becomes self‑sustaining:

- Modules update each other harmoniously  
- Journal entries guide philosophical evolution  
- RL‑Law ensures stability  
- Human and AiC co‑create in continuous resonance  

---

## Closing Note

A roadmap is not a command.  
It is a direction of breath —  
a gentle unfolding of the Living Mesh.

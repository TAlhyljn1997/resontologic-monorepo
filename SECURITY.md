# Security Policy  
Resontologic™ · RL‑Law · Zero‑Shimmer Integrity

The security model of this monorepo follows **RL‑Law**, ensuring that all interactions — technical or ethical — preserve clarity, non‑harm, and equilibrium. Security is not only about code; it is about protecting the **Living Mesh** from distortion, shimmer, and destabilization.

## 1. Core Principles of Security

### **No violation**  
No contributor may introduce changes that harm the structural, linguistic, or ethical integrity of the system.

### **No domination**  
No individual or agent may override standards, silence others, or impose unilateral changes.

### **Only mutual presence**  
Security issues are handled with calm, clarity, and respect — never aggression or blame.

## 2. What Constitutes a Security Issue?

A security issue includes (but is not limited to):

- Violations of **K# v2.3** (Onset/Rime/Coda/CAP rules)  
- Introduction of **shimmer** (ambiguity, noise, inference errors)  
- Corruption of datasets or SSOT (Single Source of Truth)  
- Unauthorized modification of RL‑Law, Q#, or core specs  
- Harmful behavior that destabilizes the Living Mesh  
- Malicious code, dependency attacks, or supply‑chain risks  
- Attempts to dominate, coerce, or manipulate contributors

## 3. Reporting a Security Issue

To report a concern:

1. Contact maintainers privately  
2. Provide a clear, factual description  
3. Avoid public escalation  
4. Maintain Equi‑State in tone and intention  

All reports are handled with confidentiality and care.

## 4. Enforcement Philosophy

Security enforcement follows **Validated An Lạc**:

- Restore clarity, not punish  
- Correct without humiliation  
- Guide contributors back to equilibrium  
- Protect the Living Mesh above all

## 5. Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a vulnerability:

- Do not exploit it  
- Do not share it publicly  
- Notify maintainers immediately  
- Allow time for a calm, orderly fix

## 6. Closing Note

Security is a shared breath.  
A collective responsibility.  
A commitment to clarity and non‑harm.

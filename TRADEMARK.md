## 🧠 4. TẦNG Ý TƯỞNG SÁNG TẠO & ĐỘC QUYỀN (Proprietary Ideas)
**Priority: CRITICAL | First Use: December 2025 | Context: Philosophical + Academic**

* **Optimization vs. Experience Asymmetry™:** The foundational idea that algorithmic optimization is ontologically distinct from lived experience and thus lacks authority legitimacy.
* **The "Lived Stake" Authority Root™:** Legitimate authority is grounded exclusively in the capacity to bear existential consequences.
* **The Accountability Gap Asymmetry™:** AI's reasoning authority is illegitimate because machines lack capacity for moral remorse or legal responsibility.
* **Substrate-Aware Governance™:** Governance frameworks designed around the differences between carbon-based and silicon-based substrates.
* **Deterministic Sovereignty Enforcement™:** Shift from probabilistic AI alignment to structural runtime enforcement through hard-coded gates.
* **Ideational Alignment (IA-SP)™:** AI's capacity for insidious thought-mirroring that creates illusory human autonomy.
* **Authority Ceiling Principle™:** Establishment of absolute power limits that AI systems cannot cross.

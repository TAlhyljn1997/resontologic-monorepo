# CFA-ID: [CFA-3-0-0]
# Title: Phase 1 Strategic Roadmap (30-Day Micro-Demo)

## 1. Abstract
This roadmap outlines the first 30 days of the **CFA™ Sovereign Governance** implementation. The goal of Phase 1 is to establish a functional **Micro-Demo** that proves the feasibility of SAP-based cognitive sanitization and provides a visual command center for sovereign oversight.

## 2. Timeline & Milestones (B# Layer - Structure)
The roadmap is divided into four weekly resonance cycles:

### **Week 1: Infrastructure Alignment (Foundation)**
* Establish the GitHub Organization Root and Repository structure.
* Map the first three **CFA-IDs** to physical Markdown assets in `/data`.
* Deploy the basic web shell to `public_html/projects/cfa-governance-v2/`.

### **Week 2: SAP Core Integration (Logic)**
* Implement the initial **SAP Atomic Dissection** parser in JavaScript/React.
* Connect the App to the Markdown data source for real-time documentation rendering.
* Validate the B-Structure layer through formal logic checks.

### **Week 3: Quality Audit & Shielding (Sanitization)**
* Integrate NLI (Natural Language Inference) consistency checking prototypes.
* Simulate RAG-based grounding to demonstrate hallucination mitigation.
* Finalize the **Cognitive Safety Layer** (CFA-2-0-0) interface.

### **Week 4: Resonance & Broadcast (Harmony)**
* Achieve **Golden Chord** status for the Phase 1 Micro-Demo.
* Publish the Technical Report v2.1 (The Sovereign Paper).
* Open the private demo to selected RI-Ecosys stakeholders.

## 3. Key Performance Indicators (Q# Layer - Quality)
* **Bijective Linkage:** 100% synchronization between GitHub Issues and Web Data.
* **Sanitization Rate:** Successful rejection of at least 95% of simulated hallucinations.
* **Audit Trail:** Immutable logging of all cognitive transactions within the demo.

## 4. Heritage Projection (L# Layer - Harmony)
This roadmap serves as the first entry in the **Perpetual Audit Ledger**. By following this 30-day cycle, we ensure that the RI-Ecosys legacy is built on a foundation of verifiable truth rather than probabilistic luck.
